# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator and empty arrays.  The issue arises when using `$in` with an array that is unexpectedly empty.  Instead of returning all documents (as one might intuitively expect), the query returns no results.

This can be a subtle error, particularly when dealing with dynamically generated queries or arrays that might be empty under certain conditions.  The solution involves carefully handling cases where the array used with `$in` is empty.
